I met Bob in Tokyo in the late 80‚Äôs.I‚Äôd just been to the Tokyo National Museum in Ueno,and was walking through the park,when this guy walking towards me stops in his tracks,I say ‚ÄúBob Robert‚Äôs‚Äù and he says ‚Äú you must be Luke‚Äù.From that day on we spent a lot of time together on his trip to Japan,we had a lot of mutual friends, Horiyoshi III included.So say no more,we had a lot of fun,and it continued through our journeys,I was lucky enough to work at Spotlight and meet Charlie and many kool kats.Thankyou Bob,got my Buffalo Bob Dragon too,to keep those memories alive.A character and talent beyond!  Rest well wherever you are‚Ä¶.. Condolences to Charlie Ava and the familyüôèüôè","location":"Stuttgart-Feuerbach"}
